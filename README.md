# Academic Pages
**Academic Pages is a GitHub Pages template for personal and professional portfolio-oriented websites.**

![Academic Pages template example](images/themes/homepage-light.png "Academic Pages template example")

# Getting Started

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Click the "Use this template" button in the top right.
1. On the "New repository" page, enter your public repository name as "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Edit site-wide configuration in `_config.yml` and double check that the `url` is the one that you just selected in the previous step and that `repository` reflects the correct path for your repository.
1. Add your site content, upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the `files/` directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
1. (Optional) Use the Jupyter notebooks or python scripts in the `markdown_generator` folder to generate markdown files for publications and talks from a TSV file.

### Additional Tutorials

Additional tutorials for working with the Academic Pages template can be found at the following sites:

## Running locally

When you are initially working on your website, it is very useful to be able to preview the changes locally before pushing them to GitHub. To work locally you will need to:

1. Clone the repository and made updates as detailed above.

### Using a different IDE

1. Install [rbenv and ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation), initialize rbenv in your shell, and install Node.js. On macOS:

    ```bash
    brew install rbenv ruby-build node
    rbenv init
    ```

    Restart your shell after initialization. On Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux, follow the rbenv installation instructions and install the build dependencies required by ruby-build and native gems.

1. From the repository directory, install the Ruby version pinned in `.ruby-version`:

    ```bash
    rbenv install -s "$(cat .ruby-version)"
    ruby -v
    rbenv which ruby
    ```

    Ruby should report `3.4.12`, and its path should be under your rbenv `versions` directory. The `.ruby-version` file selects this Ruby automatically when you enter the repository; the Gemfile also enforces this version.

1. Install the Bundler version recorded in `Gemfile.lock`, then configure project-local gems:

    ```bash
    gem install bundler --version 4.0.15 --no-document
    bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle
    bundle install
    ```

    Gems are installed in `vendor/bundle`, and the local configuration is saved in `.bundle/config`. Both directories are ignored by Git. Keep `Gemfile.lock` in version control: it records the dependency versions needed to reproduce the build. Use `bundle install` when returning to the project; update dependencies deliberately with `bundle update` and review the resulting lockfile changes. Do not delete the lockfile as a troubleshooting step.

1. Run `make build` to verify the site, or `make` to preview it at `http://localhost:4000`. The preview rebuilds automatically after Markdown and HTML changes. Restart it after changing `_config.yml`.

## Using Docker

Working from a different OS, or just want to avoid installing dependencies? You can use the provided `Dockerfile` to build a container that will run the site for you if you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

You can build and execute the container by running the following command in the repository:

```bash
chmod -R 777 .
docker compose up
```

You should now be able to access the website from `localhost:4000`.

### Using the DevContainer in VS Code

If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) you can use the [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) that comes with this Repository. Normally VS Code detects that a development container configuration is available and asks you if you want to use the container. If this doesn't happen you can manually start the container by **F1->DevContainer: Reopen in Container**. This restarts your VS Code in the container and automatically hosts your academic page locally on http://localhost:4000. All changes will be updated live to that page after a few seconds.

# Maintenance

Bug reports and feature requests to the template should be [submitted via GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/new/choose). For questions concerning how to style the template, please feel free to start a [new discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions).

This repository was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is © 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License (see LICENSE.md). It is currently being maintained by [Robert Zupko](https://github.com/rjzupkoii), and additional maintainers would be welcome.

## Bugfixes and enhancements

If you have bugfixes and enhancements that you would like to submit as a pull request, you will need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository as opposed to using it as a template. This will also allow you to [synchronize your copy](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) of the template to your fork as well.

Unfortunately, one logistical issue with a template theme like Academic Pages that makes it a little tricky to get bug fixes and updates to the core theme. If you use this template and customize it, you will probably get merge conflicts if you attempt to synchronize, although [rebasing](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) the changes from this template will work along with manually [cherry picking](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) the relevant commits. If you are not comfortable with the Git command line, you can save your various `.yml` configuration files and Markdown files, delete the repository, and fork it again.
